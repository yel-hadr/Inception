# Docker System Administration Exercise

## Introduction

Welcome to the documentation of my project! This document is a System Administration related exercise, where I have learned to work with Docker and Docker Compose. I have constructed a total of 7 containers, each with its own unique function.

## Container Functions

1. **NGINX with TLSv1.3**
   - Description: NGINX container configured with TLSv1.3.
   
2. **WordPress and php-fpm**
   - Description: WordPress and php-fpm installed and configured.
   
3. **MariaDB**
   - Description: MariaDB container for database management.
   
4. **Redis Cache**
   - Description: Redis cache for the WordPress website, essential for proper cache management.
   
5. **FTP Server**
   - Description: FTP server container pointing to the volume of your WordPress website.
   
6. **Static Website**
   - Description: Container for a simple static website.
   
7. **cAdvisor**
   - Description: Container hosting cAdvisor to monitor Docker container resource usage.

## Docker Compose

The aforementioned seven containers are interconnected using Docker Compose. This tool provides a simplified method to configure and manage all the containers as a single service, allowing for easy orchestration of multi-container Docker applications.
